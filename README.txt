Google FooBar Challenges!


"Foobar" is a term used to refer to a set of coding challenges presented by Google in an invite-only format.
It is a secret recruiting process where Google invites potential job candidates, typically developers and engineers,
to participate in a series of coding challenges. The challenges are designed to assess the problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking,
and coding abilities of the candidates.

I left them because in my opinion the best way to learn and grow is to review our past mistakes!
